Abstract: Human Machine teaming has gained importance in the defence sector with the integration of Aritficial Intelligence in the field. HMT is basically the process of integrating the human factor in the decisions made by the algorithms to reduce the possibility of errors. The project phase 1 required development of a multi-nodal drone swarm control system which had remote access capabilities. All phase 1 requirements were completed under the supervison of officials from INMAS Delhi.

Significant amount of work was done using [Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org/) or ROS. The source code for the library is writeen in C and py3.7, and has capability of creating multiple nodes, where each node represents an actuator or robot. The algorithms for control were simulated on [Unity3D](https://unity.com/), to check command latency and other parameters.

The cover image is of an initial drone rendering, from early-on in the project, when gazebo was used for simulation.
