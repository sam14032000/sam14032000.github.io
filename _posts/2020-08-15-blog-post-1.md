One thing that every data scienctist knows is how to deploy a neural net of its advanced versions using one of the big python libraries like tensorflow or pytorch. So why go through the pain of writing the model from (almost) scratch?  

Designing a ML model for a given dataset requires the programmer to go through certain steps, first to preprocess the data aand the second is tuning the parameters of the model. This article will delve into the second part and explain how learning the workings of a ML model might help us understand parameter tuning.
