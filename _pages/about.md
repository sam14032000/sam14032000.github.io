My name is Saksham Agrawal. I am an undergrad student at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/), Goa Campus, pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science along with a M.Sc. in Economics. Early in my first year I got interested in Artificial Intelligence. I began exploring the topic through aviation and aerodynamics. Initially I replicated a few basic studies on flight path prediction and moved on to drone swarming. After deploying ML models, I got interested in the source code of the models which led me to bayesian statistics, kernel methods and neural nets. My second major in Economics, introduced me to Econometrics and Computational Finance, both of which have been my major fields of research for the past two years. Since then, my major aim has been to learn more about methods to quantify sentiment and information flow between global economies and financial markets.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
