My name is Saksham Agrawal. I am an undergrad student at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/), Goa Campus, pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science along with a M.Sc. in Economics. Early in my first year I got interested in Artificial Intelligence. I began exploring the topic through aviation and aerodynamics. Initially I replicated a few basic studies on flight path prediction and moved on to drone swarming. After deploying ML models, I got interested in the source code of the models which led me to bayesian statistics, kernel methods and neural nets. My second major in Economics, introduced me to Econometrics and Computational Finance, both of which have been my major fields of research for the past two years. Since then, my major aim has been to learn more about methods to quantify sentiment and information flow between global economies and financial markets.

## Research Interests & Projects pursued
Broadly, my research interests are split into Artificial Intelligence, Econometrics & Computational Finance. 

Exploring AI, I worked on replicating the ALOFT project by the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, and completed a basic version of the algorithm at the end of the study in 2018. My work in Computational Finance involves two research studies, first of which decribes a VAR + LSTM hybrid prediction model, used to predict the future volatility of financial markets, completed mid-2020 and under review by a journal. The second paper is a network analysis study focused on analysing the links between different international markets, when going through certain financial events, a draft of the paper is close to completion. In Econometrics, I worked on recession analysis and volatilty transmission. Both research papers were completed in early and mid 2020 respectively, and are currently under review by journals.
