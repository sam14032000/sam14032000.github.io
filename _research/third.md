title: "Stock market volatility prediction using VAR-ML hybrid model"
excerpt: "Volatility modelling has been an important part of financial modelling for a significant amount of time. Over the years GRACH model has been the go-to model for most analysts, since its explainable and robust. However, with the advent of machine learning, the accuracy of financial models has improved significantly. GARCH model usus the residual data from VAR or VECM models to capture information aboutunexpected shocks in the market. The aim of this study is to study the next-day prediction accuracy of RNNs, when the input data is the market volatiliity, as compared to, when VAR residual data is used additionally with market volatility. <br>
