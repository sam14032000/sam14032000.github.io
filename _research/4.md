Abstract: The study uses the fixed income attribtuion method suggested by [Andrew Colin](https://www.fiasyswiki.com/index.php?title=Papers), to understand the decompostion of returns. Initially a [Nelson-Siegel model](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2352957?casa_token=_6SK4TYvWKIAAAAA:ZHuK6NunzLRMICrDhzloSisnxjptsW_bs4SEsYl2ijyPXCVwMkgLOoj2Z-ulFZYBfaDZZaKr8Vydw0-JruN_DX98GSMLH2wziP1Y-fwMwZGDsNFy0_3w) over the yield curve to create a mathematical estimation of the curve. The study's aim is to rather test a piecewise Nelson-Siegel model approach and see its accuracy. After fitting the model on the yield curve, changes in the curve (i.e. shift/twsit/buuerfly) and other variables which influence the returns of a portfolio are calculated.  Based on these, an analysis is performed over individual changes in return attributes to study the returns during the Covid-19 pandemic triggered recession. The results suggest and explain attributes which should be specially considered when choosing a robust portfolio.
