title: "Recession Prediction using Markov Regime Switching Model"
excerpt: "Based on the business cycle theory, every recession and expansion period is just a part of cyclic process. Hence it is a fair to treat different parts of the cycle as seperate regimes, where the economy resides. Over the years bond yield has acted like a measure for market sentiment and an indicator for recessions.We test the capability of bond yields in predicting recessions in multiple countries, by using a modification of the model, which uses external regressors to calculate a [time varying transition probability](https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/reswkpap/pdf/rwp98-09.pdf) developed by Andrew J. Filardo. Below is the image of predictions made by the model for USA. <br>
