title: "Recession Prediction using Markov Regime Switching Model"
excerpt: "Based on the business cycle theory, every economic recession and expansion is just part of a cyclic process. Hence it is a fair to treat different parts of the cycle as seperate regimes, where the economy resides. Over the years bond yield has acted like a measure for market sentiment and an indicator for recessions.We test the capability of bond yields in predicting recessions in multiple countries, by using a modification of the model, which uses external regressors to calculate a [time varying transition probability](https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/reswkpap/pdf/rwp98-09.pdf) developed by Andrew J. Filardo. Below is the image of predictions made by the model for USA. <br>

Over the years economies over the world have gone through several recessions. Every recession has had a different factor causal factor, something that triggered the event. In the 1930s depression, it was a combination of the Federal policies in US, and in 2008, it was the failure of housing finance market due to mortgagae debts that triggered the recession and sent the market into a free fall.
